# youth-supportbot
When youth face loneliness, a common resource they utilize to fill the void is the vast internet. 
While this may benefit them, oftentimes youth find themselves on the wrong side of the web. 
These dangerous sites can lead to detrimental outcomes. So, I developed Botty. 
Botty is a program that aims to act as a digital friend to youth facing loneliness. Botty includes a chatbot, a game which utilizes recursion, file handling to output motivational quotes, and a feature to provide feedback.
